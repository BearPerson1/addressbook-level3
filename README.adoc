* This is a CLI (Command Line Interface) Address Book application *written in OOP-fashion*. It has a very basic GUI.
* It is a simple Java application intended for NUS students to save time, by means of arranging schedules in a more convenient manner, and downloading their IVLE resources in one-click.

*What's different from the original address book*

* A function to arrange schedules via a common time-table is implemented.
* A function for students to download their IVLE materials in one-click is implemented.
